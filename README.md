## Client Control <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1015469538738970636/1097648750299717653/cc-icon.png?width=25&height=25">

This project was developed to meet the needs of a client. Similar to an excel table, the **Client Control** has interactive buttons for adding, editing and deleting records, in addition to a search bar with a limit of results and filtering organized by name, CPF, action or indication. Each interactive button has a specific modal for the function, also having a modal to show the customer's details, when clicking on the name in the table. Client Control was developed together with **[Carlos Eduardo](https://github.com/CarlosE-Dev)**, who worked on the backend. Hope you like the idea!
